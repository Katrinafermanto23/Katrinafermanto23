# Hi! My name is Katrina Fermanto
I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a dual degree in Business Administration and Psychology. 
I'm passionate about the world of tech and entertainment and have been using data to leverage insights to forge meaningful connections between customers and our products. This has helped me excel in my previous roles as a PM, Analyst and Marketer at NVIDIA, Warner Music Group, Tesla, McKinsey & Co and L'Or√©al.

Outside of work I love reading, writing and learning more about the world of Psychology. I strongly believe that learning more about customer behavior is the foundation to building a product that truly resonates with out customers!
